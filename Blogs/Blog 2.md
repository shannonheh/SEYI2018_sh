#Blog 2: Five Weeks Over, Two Weeks Left.#

Five weeks are over already, yet I feel like the internship has barely started. Since the submission for Blog 1, the interns and I have gone on two field trips to New Brighton State Beach and Pinnacles National Park.

##New Brighton State Beach##
I finally got to visit New Brighton State Beach! Last year, I did not attend due to an out-of-state competition. Early morning, we drove through the fog and mountains down to Santa Cruz, where the beach is located. 

Noel noted that we would be searching for fossils from the border of the Miocene and the Pliocene, about 5 million years ago. Originally expecting to see a few whale fossils scattered on the sand, I was overwhelmed (in a positive sense) by the abundance of fossils on the cliff beds, rocks, and in the sand. My favorite part was being able to apply my knowledge of bivalves and gastropods, which I had learned through Noel’s lab the week before, to identify fossils. I was also surprised by how well-preserved some shells were, as indicated by their pearly-white or iridescent exterior. I enjoyed seeing the various wildlife, like purple-green crabs, sea anemones, kelp forests, and (terrifyingly huge) isopods. After about one hour of strolling aside the cliff wall and exploring the fossils, we were forced to head back by the rising tide which was wetting our feet.

At the beach, I got to interact more with the individual interns, with whom I ate lunch. After lunch, we headed to the UCSC Marine Science Institute, which had a beautiful view of the ocean and two large whale skeletons. I had never known about vestigial structures in the whale which indicate that whales used to live on land! While I love exploring the beach, I was hoping we would see tide pools. I LOVE TIDEPOOLS. I was recently in Washington State, where I participated in a tour with a naturalist. She took me to a quiet tide pool in Port Angeles, where I saw sea anemone, mussels, chiten, crabs, kelp, and sea worms everywhere. Thanks to Jenny and Noel, I now know where tidepools are in the Bay Area and how to track tides with an app, activities I will surely do once SEYI is over.

##Pinnacles field trip##
Only one week later was camping, and I was so excited! Unfortunately, I forgot, from the year before, about the scorching 100-degree heat. We started our trip by searching the side of the highway for fossils of tiny crabs and bivalves; who knew you could find evidence of ancient Geologic Time from the road-side? Upon arriving at the Pinnacles campsite, the interns and I immediately left to hike on a trail that leads to caves. Sadly, the caves were closed (*womp womp*), so we headed on a different path that leads to a reservoir. The area reminded me of Zion Canyon, with its tall, red rock formation. The rocks we saw were formed from a volcanic eruption; I kept wondering how the rocks stuck together despite the presence of numerous cracks cutting into the rock wall. After a trek through tunnels and up steep stairs, we finally arrived at the reservoir. While this picturesque reservoir seemed out of place compared to the surrounding cliffs, I was mesmerized by its beauty and abundance of wildlife. Dragonflies colored a vibrant blue and red, in addition to thin damsel flies, zoomed across the grass next to the reservoir. We also saw a frog, garter snake, and an assortment of birds like the turkey vulture and quails, whose flying sounded like a storm!

That same evening, we enjoyed delicious chicken fajitas. Similar to last year, a swarm of wasps buzzed around the meat; however, I am glad for I may have slightly conquered my fear of wasps. After having them buzz around me so much, I realized that wasps are less of a danger and more of a nuisance. At 11 PM, the Biodiversity group gathered outside in the darkness and watched for shooting stars on a beautiful, cloudless night.

The next morning, after only one uncomfortable hour of sleep, Ameya and I awoke at 5 AM and cleaned up our tent and belongings in preparation for the hike. Despite the sores from the hike the day before, I surprisingly was energized and was ready to tackle the hike. The year before, the hike was extremely tough. Despite the excruciating heat and lack of water, I tried to keep pace with the front of the group, which made me very nauseous by the time I reached the top. This year, the experience was very different. I realized that I should go at my own pace and take breaks whenever I found bits of shade. I also brought three bottles of water and tangerines to quench my thirst. I was happy that a few other Biodiversity interns kept pace with me, as we encouraged each other to reach the top. As always, the view at the summit was breathtaking. I always find it so amazing that the exact same valley and summit exists in Southern California, due to the San Andreas Fault which separated the volcano. 

On the way down, the hike felt unexpectedly much longer than I had imagined. After rolling my ankle five times and many complaints about why we weren’t there yet (*Thank you Ameya and Noel for bearing through my comments*), I was relieved to reach the bottom safely.

##Project Progress##

Within a couple weeks, Noah and I have made significant progress on our portion of the research paper. We are analyzing how the motility level of marine genera relates to body size evolution and extinction selectivity across time. We have made seven figures, including two boxplots showing body size vs motility level, a plot showing the proportion of motile and nonmotile genera overtime, numerous color-coded plots showing the stratigraphic ranges of genera, and plots of extinction rate and selectivity. We are very proud of our plots, and will be presenting them to Noel and Biodiversity interns for feedback. From our analysis so far, we find that the proportion of motile genera tend to decrease over-time, with mass extinctions causing transformative drops. We also learned that motile genera tend to have a larger body size, though the difference is only by an order of magnitude. With the team’s feedback, we hope to improve the design of our graphs and conduct more analyses. 

##Well-Deserved Thank You’s##
Thank you Jenny, Noel, and Nic (and anyone else involved) for arranging these awesome and immersive field trips.
Thank you Noel for all your help in debugging code and understanding the results.
